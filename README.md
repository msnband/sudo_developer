client - server

Introduction
A client-server application can be simplified to describe a model wherein a program (the server) receives and handles requests of services done by another program (the client). The server program awaits requests done by the client program and begins working on a request as soon as it is received. The two programs are often referred to as one application.

The client-server model is used all around us; websites, chat programs, and email are just a few examples.

The Server
For this assignment, the file-managing server is required to handle multiple clients connecting to it where each client might work in a directory of their own and with files inaccessible to other users. If a user is already logged in, further requests to log in with that username should be denied. However, the server is only required to be able to handle one service request at a time. Do note that service requests done by different users should not interfere with one another unless necessary. For instance, if two users use the command "read_file" but with different files, then subsequent calls done by these users are to handle the specific user's file and not any other file. 

The server must be able to handle two different kinds of usersâ€”user and admin. Some service requests must be denied if done by a user and not an admin.

File Structure

A sample directory structure is provided with this assignment but is not required for use. Note that this structure is created with two users in mind, one admin and one user. Service requests are never to be allowed to traverse outside of a given server structure. The structure can be found here.

Root
|---Admin
       |---top_secret_data
              |---pictures_of_cats   
       |---not_so_secret_data
|---User
       |---pictures_of_dogs
       |---py_code

Registered users, folders, files, and other implementation data must be saved between sessions! Users created during one session must be usable the next time the server is started, and all folders, files, and data are to be properly accessible.

How the server keeps tab on this structure is up to you; it is strongly recommended that you start this assignment with sitting down in your group and define how the server keeps track of all files.

Services

The server is to be supporting a subset of commands commonly found on UNIX-based systems. These commands are heavily simplified compared to their UNIX counterparts and are the services of the server. Please refer to the table below for the different services that are expected of the server, as well as how they are to be used. If a request of service is conducted with an unknown command or an erroneous input, proper information is to be passed back to the client.

Service command	Description	Options
change_folder <name>	Move the current working directory for the current user to the specified folder residing in the current folder. If the <name> does not point to a folder in the current working directory, the request is to be denied with a proper message highlighting the error for the user. 	To walk back the previous folder, a <name> of two dots (..) is provided. This should only be available if the user is not currently standing in Root. This overrides the <name> rule in the previous box.
list	
Print all files and folders in the current working directory for the user issuing the request. This command is expected to give information about the name, size, date and time of creation, in an easy-to-read manner. Shall not print information regarding content in sub-directories.

-
read_file <name>

Read data from the file <name> in the current working directory for the user issuing the request and return the first hundred characters in it. Each subsequent call by the same client is to return the next hundred characters in the file, up until all characters are read. If a file with the specified <name> does not exist in the current working directory for the user, the request is to be denied with a proper message highlighting the error for the user. 	A service request without a <name> variable should close the currently opened file from reading. Subsequent calls with this file as <name> should start reading from the beginning of the file.
write_file <name> <input>	Write the data in <input> to the end of the file <name> in the current working directory for the user issuing the request, starting on a new line.  If no file exists with the given <name>, a new file is to be created in the current working directory for the user.	If <input> is empty, then the specified file is to be cleared of content.
create_folder <name>	Create a new folder with the specified <name> in the current working directory for the user issuing the request. If a folder with the given name already exists, the request is to be denied with a proper message highlighting the error for the user. 	-
register <username> <password> <privileges>	Register a new user with the <privileges> to the server using the <username> and <password> provided. If a user is already registered with the provided <username>, the request is to be denied with a proper message highlighting the error for the user. A new personal folder named <username> should be created on the server. The <privileges> should be either user or admin.	-
login <username> <password>	Log in the user conforming with <username> onto the server if the <password> provided matches the password used while registering. If the <password> does not match or if the <username> does not exist, an error message should be returned to the request for the client to present to the user.	-
delete <username> <password>	Delete the user conforming with <username> from the server. This service is only available to users with a privilege level of admin, and <password> is to be the password of the admin currently logged in. If the request is done by a user that does not have admin privileges, <password> does not match or if the <username> does not exist, an error message should be returned to the request for the client to present to the user. 	-
The server is to be assumed listening for connections on localhost (127.0.0.1), port 8080.

The Client
For this assignment, the client is taking a more passive role. When started up, it should present the user with the option to either login or register to the server.  These options are to result in requests to the server, and a login is only to be allowed if the username and password matches with the information on the server.  Once logged in, the client should have the user's personal folder as starting point to work with. 

The user should be able to input any command described for the server. Whenever a command is issued, the client is to send a request to the server and present the result to the user if applicable. The client is also required to save down all commands issued by each user.

Lastly, the client got two commands that they are to directly handle themselves:

Command	Description	Option
commands	Print information about all available commands, including expected input and what alternative usage they have.	If this command is followed by the string "issued", then all commands the user has sent, including input, are to be presented on the screen in an easy to read fashion. 

If this command is followed by the string "clear", then all commands issued by the user is to be cleared from the client.
quit	Logout the user, close the connection to the server, and close the application.	-
Testing and Error Handling
You are expected to write tests using asserts as well as either the doctest or unittest module for both the server and the client. It is up to you to decide exactly how many tests that are to be written.

The tests implemented with asserts are to be used for simpler tests, for instance the input to functions.

The tests implemented with the doctest or unittest module are to be clearly documented in a separate report. This text must highlight why these tests where chosen, what they test, and how it is tested. This report should not contain code, but be an overview of the reasoning behind the test and how these tests were identified as necessary.  The report is also required to contain a section arguing why the number of implemented tests were deemed enough and what areas of the code that are not tested.
